# Data-Science-Portfolio
It is my data science portfolio in order to demonstrate my evolution 

My goal is to build a portfolio in Data Science, in Python, R and SQL.

TThis portfolio will be built in accordance with the SMART method.

For George T. Doran, a goal must be SMART. SMART stands for “specific”, “measurable”, “achievable”, “relevant” and “time-bound”.

1) "Specific":My goal is to build 5 data science projects with the aim of demonstrating my data science knowledge.

2) "Mmeasurable": 5 data science projects.

3) "Ambitious, but also for achievable or appropriate": 

4) "R for realistic and relevant"

5) "T for time-bound": 5 months
